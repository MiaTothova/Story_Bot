Story Bot is a terminal-based Madlib game. It is mainly aimed at children of 6 years and up who are learning or already know how to read and write.
It was designed to provide a fun approach to story building where the child can choose from words provided and see the output resulting in a funny silly story that can be played over and over again each time resulting in a different output.


## UX

The creation of this Madlib game was aimed at children. My 2 older children who are between the ages of 5 and 10 love them and they are very popular within this age group. So the aim was to be able to let them choose a story, give them the ability to select words from a list, and then see these words printed out to them in a fun short story. 

#### The ideal client:
* Children
* Young adults and adults

* Insert their name
* Make a selection based on options provided
* Easy terminal navigation
