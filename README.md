Story Bot is a terminal-based Madlib game. It is mainly aimed at children of 6 years and up who are learning or already know how to read and write.
It was designed to provide a fun approach to story building where the child can choose from words provided and see the output resulting in a funny silly story that can be played over and over again each time resulting in a different output.


## UX

The creation of this Madlib game was aimed at children. My 2 older children who are between the ages of 5 and 10 love them and they are very popular within this age group. So the aim was to be able to let them choose a story, give them the ability to select words from a list, and then see these words printed out to them in a fun short story. 

#### The ideal client:
* Children
* Young adults and adults
* English speakers
* Readers 
* People who love Madlibs

### The game will help clients to:
* Insert their name
* Make a selection based on options provided
* Easy terminal navigation
* Test their reading skills
* Test their imagination
* Provide entertainment

2. Users select words from predefined lists to fill placeholders in the story.
3. Users have a choice of 4 Madlib stories.
4. The game is designed to keep the user engaged through constant interaction. Each story requires multiple inputs from the user, keeping the session interactive.
5. Easy game exit.

### Future features
1. Expand the library of characters, settings, and plot elements, allowing for more detailed customization of stories.
2. Save score and top 5 scores.
3. Allow users to contribute their own story templates, characters, and word lists, which can be shared with others in a community library.
4. Develop a mobile version of the game, making it accessible on smartphones and tablets.


## The Design
The design of Story Bot focuses on being simple and user-friendly. It uses colorful text to make the game easy to navigate and understand, helping players focus on the fun of storytelling. The game is text-based, which keeps it straightforward and lets players use their imagination to make their own stories. Colors help differentiate between types of text, which enhances readability and interaction. The game is designed to be enjoyable for everyone, especially children.
